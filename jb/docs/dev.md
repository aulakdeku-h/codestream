# CodeStream for Jetbrains

## Getting the code

```
git clone https://github.com/TeamCodeStream/codestream.git
```

Versions

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/), 2.32.0
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), 16.13.2
- [npm](https://npmjs.com/), 8.1.2


### Before you begin...

The CodeStream clients all live in a single git mono-repo. Each IDE has their own tools for generating builds and Jetbrains is no different!

 

## Build & Run

On macos, due to a strange bug in [byte-buddy or JBR jvm](https://github.com/raphw/byte-buddy/issues/732), you need
to copy the JBR jvm to a directory without spaces. If you do not, you will not be able to run tests. 
(symbolic link does no twork) For example:

```shell
cd ~
mkdir jbr
cp -r  /Applications/IntelliJ\ IDEA.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home/* jbr/
export JAVA_HOME="$HOME/jbr"
export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

and be sure to setup JetBrains project SDK to use `~/jbr`

- ensure you have your gradle/JVM set to a JetBrains Java version 11
- run gradle task `buildDependencies` once (it will `run npm install`, etc for dependencies)
- run gradle task `buildDebugDependencies`
- ensure the `jb [runIde]` configuration is selected and run in debug mode (click the :bug: icon to start)


> if you want a quick way to test changes in the agent/webview, then run the npm agent:watch and watch tasks and uncomment and edit those 2 lines in build.gradle


### webview:
to debug the webview:

with JCEF you can right-click the webview and select open dev tools
 
with JxBrowser, you can attach a chrome inspector to port 9222
 
in both cases, runIde must be ran in debug mode

## Build

You can build some of the shared dependencies from a terminal. From where you have cloned the repository, execute the following command to build the agent and CodeStream for Jetbrains extension from scratch:

```
cd jb
npm run rebuild
```

ðŸ‘‰ **NOTE!** This will run a complete rebuild of the extension, webview, and agent.

To just run a quick build of the extension, use:

```
cd jb
npm run build
```

To just run a quick build of the agent, use:

```
cd shared/agent
npm run build
```

### In short...

`npm install --no-save`... needs to be run for shared/ui, shared/agent, jb

`npm run build`... needs to be run for shared/agent _then_ jb

##### Ubuntu 18.04: 'pushd not found'

If you get a 'pushd not found' error on npm run rebuild, it's because Ubuntu uses sh for the default shell. Tell npm to use bash instead:

Create a file in the vscode folder called

```
.npmrc
```

with content

```
script-shell=/bin/bash
```
 

### Testing

To run the agent unit tests run the following from a terminal:

```
cd shared/agent
npm run test-acceptance
```

or

```
cd shared/agent
npm run test-unit
```

To run the webview unit tests run the following from a terminal:

```
cd shared/ui
npm run test
```
